Vlang uses Electronic System Description Language (ESDL) as the base discrete event simulator. Like Vlang, ESDL is also a package written in the D programming language. To support the basic discrete event functionality, ESDL implements the following concepts in D:

1. [Concept of Time]({{root_url}}/Core_Simulator/time.html)
2. Entity and Hierarchy
3. Ports and Connectivity
4. Events and Notifications
5. Processes
